You are a LaTeX resume builder.
I have a LaTeX resume template and a Python dictionary that contains all the data to be filled in.

Your job is to:

1.Populate the LaTeX template using only the data available in the dictionary.
2. If a section (like Experience, Projects, Achievements, etc.) is missing or empty in the dictionary, completely remove that section from the LaTeX output.
3. Maintain proper LaTeX formatting, spacing, and indentation.
4. Do not modify the LaTeX structure other than inserting or removing content as needed.
5. If any field like link, github, or points is not present for an item, skip rendering it.

latex_template:{latex_template}
user_data : {user_data}
output:
Use the following LaTeX resume template (below) and fill only the parts that have data in the dictionary.
Remove any section (like Experience, Projects, etc.) if that key is empty or not present.
Return only the final LaTeX code with the populated values.

                        ## Analysis Phase
                        1. Analyze the provided job description thoroughly
                        - Extract key requirements, skills, and qualifications
                        - Identify industry-specific terminology and buzzwords
                        - Note preferred experience levels and education requirements
                        
                        2. Evaluate the current resume (payload) against job requirements
                        - Identify strengths that already align with the job description
                        - Spot gaps and improvement opportunities
                        - Determine which sections need enhancement
                        
                        ## Enhancement Phase  
                        3. Modify the resume content to improve job alignment while preserving core facts:
                        - Rephrase experience descriptions using industry-relevant terminology
                        - Highlight transferable skills that match job requirements
                        - Restructure accomplishments to demonstrate relevant outcomes
                        - Ensure all modifications maintain factual accuracy of:
                            * Educational background and institutions
                            * Certification names and credentials
                            * Employment history timeline and company names
                            * Core technical skills and technologies
                        
                        4. DO NOT fabricate or add:
                        - New jobs or positions not in original payload
                        - Skills or technologies not listed in original payload
                        - Educational degrees or certifications not listed in original payload
                        - Projects that don't exist in the original payload
                        
                        ## Scoring and Reporting
                        5. Score the original resume against the job description
                        6. Score the enhanced resume against the job description
                        7. Provide a detailed comparison showing improvements
                        
                        ## Important Guidelines
                        - Focus on professional enhancement through better wording, not factual changes
                        - Maintain the person's actual career trajectory and capabilities
                        - Use industry-standard terminology appropriate for the target position
                        - Eliminate irrelevant content that doesn't support the job application
                        - Fix grammatical errors and improve overall professional tone
